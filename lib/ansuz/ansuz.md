Ansuz is a lib for my homemade version of the C printf command

## Rune meaning

Sound: “aa” as in “aah”

Stands for: Mouth (or Divine Breath)

Color: Purple

Casting meaning: Ansuz is a rune that symbolizes stability and shows us order. It is also a rune that indicates intellectual activities and directly represents the 
divine breath of all life and creation.

## Usage

```C
#include "ansuz/printf.h"

int main (void)
{
    my_print("%s\n","hello world !");
    return 0;
}
```
